Instructions on how to run Jeopardy:

1. Open the Microsoft Access database file "Jeopardy" located in the Jeopardy Game folder
	Note: Do not move this file, it needs to be in the same folder as the .exe (Application) file. Do not change the name of this file. The program will not run if the filename has been changed or if the file has been moved. If the file needs to be moved, both the .exe file and the databade must be in the same folder.

2. Follow these rules when entering your data in the database:
